    <p>Time flies when you work at the <a href="http://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. I think it might be the happiest place on earth for programmers. Like Disney World, there's so much you can do with your time, in so many different programming areas. I'm constantly impressed by the variety of interesting projects people are working on, from sleep cycle and karaoke apps to music and video production/processing frameworks, and, best of all, a <a href="http://googledrive.com/host/0B_veOABcE-dQdHhES1VvSWdnV0E">corgi javascript web app</a>! The people are supportive, hard-working, diverse, and curious. The workspace has windows, clean bathrooms, comfortable desks, and free aeropress coffee!</p>

<p>Unlike Disney World, there's no place for Sleeping Beauty. More than once I've found myself wide awake, not even wired on caffeine, in the wee hours of the morning, unable to stop my brain from trying to assemble a plan of action for all the things I want to learn and build in the next several weeks. On my first day at RC, I started reading through Wes McKinney's "Python for Data Analysis" which helped me understand numpy and pandas in a much deeper way than before. I hadn't finalized a project yet, so reading a textbook was a good way to fill my time while I stewed over project ideas and learned how to use Zulip, our internal chat system. After a couple of days, I wanted to start building things like everyone else and practicing python syntax, so I made a very simple game that can be used to practice indexing numpy arrays.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the first week, I settled on a project. I'm building a web scraper that collects data from Indeed.com on job postings that have "Data Scientist" in the title. I then process the text from each job posting to extract a list of skills that the company expects or desires of job applicants. I came up with the idea for this project before I had even heard about RC. I thought it would be a good way to learn python as well as find out what programming skills I should be learning next in order to be in a good position to get a data science job. The best thing about this project is that it's simultaneously teaching me about python, web scraping, object oriented programming, and pandas. Future directions will simultaneously teach me about relational databases, web applications (most likely Flask), and visualization (d3?). Everything I hoped to learn at RC and more! I have some preliminary results regarding the skills set desired of data scientist, but I'd like to save them for a future blog post.</p>
<p>On living in NYC: it's fantastic. See below for proof.</p>
